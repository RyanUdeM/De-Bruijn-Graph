# De-Bruijn-Graph
Hashtable based De Bruijn Graph and traversal

This is the team project of data structure cours IFT2015. The work is done by Xiao Ju and Qiang Ye at University of Montreal.
We implement a new hashtable and a De Bruijn Graph based on the hashtable to assemble DNA sequences given by TA. Then implement a Depth-first search funciton to asemble contigs.
